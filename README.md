# projectOne
## Calvin Jacobsen, Francis Jeffries, Bryan Thaoxaochay and Jim Nguyen

For this project we worked together to create a website and wanted to accomplish the following:

```
Must use at least two server-side APIs
Must use a CSS framework (Bootstrap/Foundation/Bulma/Skeleton)
Use at least one new third-party API
Must have a polished, mobile first UI
Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc)
Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals).
Must be depolyed to GitHub Pages
Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
```

The concept of our website was built around a traveler visiting a town for the first time.  They do not know the area well and would like to find a place to eat.  When the page loads, the user will enter the name of the city they would like restarant results for.

This information gets pushed to the Zomato API and displays the restaurant results in individual cards, listing the name of the restaurant, phone number, hours, types of f ood and average cost for two.  It will also display links on the bottom.  The three links will take you to zomato's information page on the website, directions, and menu.

When you click the link for the address, it loads a page to a map that uses the Google Map Services API.  On initial load, it will show the location of the restaurant.  When you hit the 'Take me there' button, it will route the directions on the map and display turn by turn directions to the right.
